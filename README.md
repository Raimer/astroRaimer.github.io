## Welcome to My Homepage

I build this homepage to share my views on the recent astrophysical studies and my daily live. The process of building such a homepage can be summarized as the following steps:

### First Step
Build a new repository and add [Just the Docs](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/) to your Jekyll siteâ€™s _config.yml as a remote theme:
```
remote_theme: pmarsceill/just-the-docs
```

### Second Step
Edit the _config.yml, index.md and add other pages in ./docs.

### Tird Step
