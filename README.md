## Welcome to My Personal Site

I build this homepage to share my views on the recent astrophysical studies and my daily live. The process of building such a homepage can be summarized as the following steps:

### First Step
Build a new repository and add [Just the Docs](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs) to your Jekyll siteâ€™s ```_config.yml``` as a remote theme:
```
remote_theme: pmarsceill/just-the-docs
```

### Second Step
Edit the ```_config.yml```, ```index.md``` and add other pages in ```./docs```. More informations about this theme are in the [documentation](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/). 


### License
This homepage is based on [Just the Docs](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs), a documentation theme for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).
