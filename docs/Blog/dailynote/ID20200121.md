### How to use LaTeX

[kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/index.html) is a free MIT-licensed Ruby library for converting text in one format to another, which is used in the [page template](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs). The following input and output formats are currently supported:
* Input: kramdown (a superset of Markdown), Markdown, Github Flavored Markdown, HTML
* Output: HTML, LaTeX, kramdown, RemoveHtmlTags (a special converter which removes HTML tags, normally used in conjunction with the LaTeX or kramdown converters)

[MathJax](https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax) is the default [math engine](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/math_engine/mathjax.html) of kramdown. As kramdown does not ship with the MathJax library,  you can access MathJax with the following snippet at the beginning of your page:
```html
<script type="text/javascript" id="MathJax-script" async
   src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js">
MathJax = {
  chtml: {mathmlSpacing: true}
};
 </script>
 ```
 where the center part
 ```html
 MathJax = {
  chtml: {mathmlSpacing: true}
};
```
sets the ```mathmlSpacing``` option of the CHTML output in order to have MathJax use MathML spacing rules rather than TeX spacing rules. This [document](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/web/start.html) describes the ways of accessing MathJax more specifically.

By default, MathJax uses the LaTeX math delimiters, which are ```\\(...\\)``` for in-line math, and ```\\[...\\]``` for displayed equations. It also recognizes the TeX delimiters ```$$...$$``` for displayed equations, but it does not define ```$...$``` as in-line math delimiters. For examples:

```\\(10^{2}\\), \(\frac{1}{2}\), $10^{2}$```
```
$$10^{2}$$
```
```
\\[\sum a_{i}\\]
```

Outputs:

\\(10^{2}\\), \(\frac{1}{2}\), $10^{2}$

$$10^{2}$$

\\[\sum a_{i}\\]

This [document](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/input/tex/index.html) provides more information about TeX and LaTeX support in MathJax.
