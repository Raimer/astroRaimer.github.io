## Giant X-ray Bubbles in the Milky Way halo

### Main takeaway

A team of scientists from German, Russia and Italy report the discovery of two giant X-ray bubbles (eROSITA bubbles) that extend approximately 14 kpc above and below the Galactic center with the X-ray telescope eROSITA aboard the Spektr-RG mission. The bubbles with sharp boundaries are not a remnant of a local supernova but part of a vast Galaxy-scale structure which could be powered by **star-formation** or **supermassive black hole activities** in the past. 

### Details

* The 0.6-1 keV map (Fig. 3 in the paper) shows that each bubble is close to spherical with a radius of about 6-7 kpc, while the Fermi bubbles are roughly elliptical.
* One-dimensional surface-brightness profiles along the Galactic longitude (Fig. 2) are qualitatively consistent with the projection of a **2 kpc thick spherical shell** with an outer diameter of 14 kpc.
* The total thermal energy of the eROSITA bubbles is almost 10 times larger than that of the Fermi bubbles, $$10^{56}$$ erg and $$10^{55}$$ erg respectively.
* **AGN feedback** (the typical luminosity of Syfert-like activity is $$10^{41}$$ erg) & **stellar feedback** (the typical kinetic energy of type II supernova ejecta is $$10^{51}$$ erg)
* The hot plasma in the eROSITA bubbles indicates the presence of a **feedback mechanism in quiescent galaxies**, which **re-heats** the hot plasma shock-heated during the collapse of the **dark-matter halo**. 
* The cooling time of the hot plasma in the halo is comparable to the **Hubble time**, so the process of **growing a galaxy** is assumed to be steady (apart from mergers) and slow.
