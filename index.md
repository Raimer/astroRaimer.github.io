I am the PhD student at Department of Astronomy, Peking University. I am goint to attend the PhD thesis defense in 2022. Good luck to my job application this year.

I'm currently working on the high energy neutrinos from star-forming galaxies/star-burst galaxies and also interseted in the gamma-ray sources detecter above 100 TeV, which give us some clues about the gamma-ray productions and neutrino productions in star-forming regions.
