## Welcome to My Homepage

I am the PhD student at Department of Astronomy, Peking University. I am goint to attend the PhD thesis defense in 2022. Good luck to my job application this year.

I'm currently working on the high energy neutrinos from star-forming galaxies/star-burst galaxies and also interseted in the gamma-ray sources detecter above 100 TeV. The Galactic gamma-ray sources in the star-forming regions give us some clues about the gamma-ray productions and neutrino productions in star-forming galaxies. 

I build this homepage to share my views on the recent astrophysical studies and my daily live. Feel free to share your views or point out my mistakes. My email address is htq@pku.edu.cn.
