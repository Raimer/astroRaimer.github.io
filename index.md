# Welcome to My Homepage❗️

<br>

My name is **Tian-Qi Huang (黄天奇)**. I am the PhD student at Department of Astronomy, Peking University. I am goint to attend the PhD thesis defense in 2022. Good luck to my job application this year.

I'm currently working on the high energy neutrinos from star-forming galaxies/star-burst galaxies and also interseted in the gamma-ray sources detecter above 100 TeV. The Galactic gamma-ray sources in the star-forming regions give us some clues about the gamma-ray productions and neutrino productions in star-forming galaxies. 

I build this homepage to share my views on the recent astrophysical studies and my daily life. Feel free to share your views or point out my mistakes.
